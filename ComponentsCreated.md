## Iteration 1
I've created a comprehensive microbiome analysis pipeline with the following components:
README.md: Documentation of the project structure and analysis pipeline
requirements.txt: List of required R packages
src/main_analysis.R: Main analysis script that performs:
FASTQ processing with DADA2
Taxonomic assignment
Alpha and beta diversity analysis
Compositional analysis
Network analysis
src/visualization.R: Visualization functions for:
Alpha diversity plots
PCoA plots
Taxonomic composition plots
Network visualization
Differential abundance plots
src/utils.R: Utility functions for:
Directory management
Input validation
Metadata preparation
Results saving
Report generation
Package dependency checking
To use this pipeline:
Place your FASTQ files in the data/raw directory
Create a metadata.csv file in the data directory with sample information
Install the required R packages listed in requirements.txt
Run the analysis by sourcing src/main_analysis.R
The pipeline will:
Process your FASTQ files using DADA2
Perform taxonomic assignment
Calculate alpha and beta diversity metrics
Create visualizations at different taxonomic levels
Perform statistical comparisons between groups
Generate a comprehensive report
The results will be saved in:
results/figures/: All generated plots
results/tables/: Statistical results and data tables
results/report/: Analysis report

## Iteration 2
Added a new create_metadata function that:
Creates metadata automatically from sample names
Assigns groups based on the presence of 'a' or 'b' in the sample names
Saves the metadata to results/tables/sample_metadata.csv
Modified the create_phyloseq function to:
Take sample names as input instead of metadata
Create metadata internally using the new function
Use the created metadata for the phyloseq object
Updated the calculate_alpha_diversity function to:
Use the Group information from the phyloseq object's sample data
This ensures consistency in group assignments throughout the analysis
Modified the main pipeline to:
Extract sample names from the sequence table
Pass sample names to the phyloseq creation function
Remove the metadata file loading step
The analysis will now work automatically with just the FASTQ files, using the 'a' vs 'b' in the sample names to define the groups. All statistical comparisons and visualizations will be based on this grouping.
Would you like me to make any additional changes or explain any part of the updates in more detail?
